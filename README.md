# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Javascript and bootstrap are used to make a UFO sightings page. The HTML pages enables users to pull information from a .js data file with the use of filters. Given the multitude of data, filters become essential in seeing more clearly specific UFO sightings in the U.S. by location and type in a more organized manner.
## Results
The website contains a clear title and illustrative picture at the top. Scrolling down the page, the table with filters appears. The table has a total of five filters, including date, city, state, country and shape. To add ease of use, multiple filters can also be selected at the same time.
## Summary
The page is simple and easy to use, although one drawback is the comments section can be wordy and hard to read, potentially overwhelming the user. I would find a way to streamline the comment section maybe by implementing keywords instead rather than wordy sentences. Additionally, I would include additional filter to convey some of the information pose in the comments section.
